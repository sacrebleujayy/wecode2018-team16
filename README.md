# wecode2018-team16

We are team 16 and ready to make an awesome mobile focused application.

# Proposed Feature
An event based application where the events are bucketed and can allow a person to choose to be the mentor of the event
- empowering the community to engage will allow organic sharing
- create an event "share the shovels"

Advertisingless sharing (allow people to find a shovel without having to read through all the posts with some kind of tagging mechanism)

## To Run

navigate into the client/src directory and run npm start, as well as going to the root directory and run node server.js to start the backend. 

## Main Architecture
Events
Mentorship / skill set / per event
