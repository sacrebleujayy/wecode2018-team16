- the ability to measure results

Consumer Experience (Design, UI, UX)
- content and features designed for your target audience
- designed to be approachable, accessible, easy to use, and aesthetically pleasing.

Meets All of the Challenge Requirements

# Proposed Feature
An event based application where the events are bucketed and can allow a person to choose to be the mentor of the event
- empowering the community to engage will allow organic sharing
- create an event "share the shovels"
Advertisingless sharing (allow people to find a shovel without having to read through all the posts with some kind of tagging mechanism)
